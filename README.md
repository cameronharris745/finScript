# finScript
Business Logic for Javascript

This was just an idea that I came up with when building a project and not really finding a decent framework that standardizes how javascript transfers business document information. It's main goal is to atleast start a discussion on how we can do this with ECMAscript as a standard object oriented method to store and change source document and cycle information.
